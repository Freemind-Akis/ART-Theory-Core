# ART-Theory-Core
Unified structure and simulations for the Temporal Field Theory (ART), covering rotation curves, CMB structure, lensing, and redshift.

**Ajallisen Resonanssin Teoria (ART)** – Temporal Resonance Theory – is a cosmological framework that models cosmic phenomena through a dynamic temporal field Φ(r, t) without invoking dark matter or inflation.

This repository collects all core modules and simulations of ART into one unified structure, with direct links to component papers and simulations.

##  Overview

The ART theory proposes that:
- Galactic rotation curves arise from time-dependent field structures
- Gravitational lensing is a perceptual shift caused by field gradients
- Redshift emerges from integrated temporal variation
- CMB multipoles form from natural resonance modes of Φ(r)

All predictions are derived from physically motivated field models, without fitted parameters.
